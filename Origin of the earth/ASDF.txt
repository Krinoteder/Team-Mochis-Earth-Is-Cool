The earth is simply perfect. Just imagine this, about 4 
and a half billion year ago our solar system was a cloud 
of gas and dust. This same cloud began rotating, and the 
rotation made it so that the earth would form in 
exactly the right place at exactly the right time.
If the earth was slightly further or closer to the sun,
it would be too cold or too hot for life and everything that 
we associate with it to be even remotely possible.
Even with all this, the chain of events that led to the
creation of life on earth required extremely specific 
requirements to be met. The presence of water was
probably brought by the collision of icy bodies with 
the earth's surface, in the vastness of our universe, 
this was extremely unlikely. 

Everything that happens on the earth is perfect. Just think
about evolution, every living being on earth is constantly 
adapting to the ever changing earth. We do this to survive
and to be able to perform our specific purpose. Bees pollinate 
plants, plants absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxigen
that other living beings like us need to stay alive.
We all have a purpose.
