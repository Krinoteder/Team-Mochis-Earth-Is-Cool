The earth is simply perfect. Just imagine this, almost 14 
billion year ago a cloud of interstellar dust and gas was 
formed. 9 billion years later, this same cloud began rotating,
and this rotation made it so that the earth would form in 
exactly the right place at exactly the right time.
If the earth was slightly further or closer to the sun,
it would be too cold or too hot for life and everything that 
we associate with it to be even remotely possible.
