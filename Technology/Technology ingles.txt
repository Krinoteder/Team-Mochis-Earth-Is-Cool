Pictures, videos and text about technology.

The Earth related to technology? It may sound strange because one would
usually think that technology is one of the things that have most affected the earth, 
but at the same time it has helped us to learn more about it, for example its places 
that we would have never discovered, how animals behave with their environment,
Practically in everything, the earth is surprising, and technology has helped us
to understand it, lately this branch of science seems to be the one that 
Harms it the most, but at the same time  it tries to solve this issue, proposing
new ways to do things without damaging the earth.

Technology is the creation of objects for ease
Of work or to satisfy some need. The invention of the
Automobile, was undoubtedly one of the greatests inventions in
History, it revolutionized means of transport and the way that 
people moved, the first mass-produced vehicle was the Ford T
towards the end of the first decade of the 1900s, like any initial
invention, it would serve for several years before being replaced.
Television was invented in the 20's, it lasted almost 30 years
In development to be able to be able to be mass-produced. It was
a good invention, but at the same time it was potentially harmful 
since it could make people adopt a sedentary life style
And not want to do their jobs. In the thirties air conditioning was
invented, which is one of the main pollutants other than cars and the
factories, but it didn't become an artifact of vital importance until 1950.
The 40's were marked by the Second World War, which gave birth to many inventions,
both dangerous and good. Some are radar, packaged food and the jeep, as well as the
atomic bomb and the nuclear arms race, which have shown us humanity's capacity for 
self-destruction. Apart from velcro, plasticine, tupperware, frisbee and microwave.
